"""Boxplot chart. From gnuplot's documentation:

Boxplots are a common way to represent a statistical dis-
tribution of values. Quartile boundaries are determined
such that 1/4 of the points have a value equal or less
than the first quartile boundary, 1/2 of the points have
a value equal or less than the second quartile (median)
value, etc. A box is drawn around the region between
the first and third quartiles, with a horizontal line at
the median value. Whiskers extend from the box to
user-specified limits. Points that lie outside these limits
are drawn individually."""
